## Introduction

The Advanced Help module allows module developers to store their help outside
the module system, in pure .html or .md (MarkDown) files. It provides a
framework that allows module and theme developers to integrate help texts in a
Drupal site, as well as exposing help to site administrators through the
administrative interface.

- For a full description of the module visit the
  [project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/advanced_help).

- To submit bug reports and feature suggestions, or to track changes
  visit the project's
  [issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/advanced_help).


## Requirements

The project's requirements can be found in the project's `composer.json`.


## Installation

You must use composer to install the 8.x-1.x branch of the
project. The exact command line is displayed on the project page,
along with the release.


## Configuration

By itself, this module doesn't do much. It assists other modules and
themes in showing help texts. Nothing will show up until you enable at
least one other module that makes use of the Advanced Help framework
or comes with a file named README.md or README.txt.
